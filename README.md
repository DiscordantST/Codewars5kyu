- Moving Zeros To The End:

Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end, 
preserving the order of the other elements.
move_zeros([1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3]) # returns [1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0]

- Simple Pig Latin:

Move the first letter of each word to the end of it, then add "ay" to the end of the word. 
Leave punctuation marks untouched.
Examples
pig_it('Pig latin is cool') # igPay atinlay siay oolcay
pig_it('Hello world !')     # elloHay orldway !

- Valid Parentheses:

Write a function that takes a string of parentheses, and determines if the order of the parentheses is valid. 
The function should return true if the string is valid, and false if it's invalid.
Examples
"()"              =>  true
")(()))"          =>  false
"("               =>  false
"(())((()())())"  =>  true
Constraints
0 <= input.length <= 100
Along with opening (() and closing ()) parenthesis, input may contain any valid ASCII characters. 
Furthermore, the input string may be empty and/or not contain any parentheses at all. 
Do not treat other forms of brackets as parentheses (e.g. [], {}, <>).

- Human Readable Time:

Write a function, which takes a non-negative integer (seconds) as input and 
returns the time in a human-readable format (HH:MM:SS)
HH = hours, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 99
MM = minutes, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
SS = seconds, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
The maximum time never exceeds 359999 (99:59:59)
